- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nancy A. Forson. I'm a computer student deeply passionate about leveraging technology to create meaningful experiences. My journey has been an exciting mix of academic learning and practical application. 
- 👀 I’m nurturing a keen interest in:
  - **Data Analysis & Visualization**---> I'm enthusiatic about translating complex data into visually appealing and informative representations. I've used Excel, PowerBi and other tools to analyze and present insights from simulations and research projects.
  - **Game Design & Development**---> Having designed and developed a game using Stencyl, I'm continuously exploring the realm of 3D game programming and learning the ropes of creating immersive gaming experiences.
  - **IoT Security Analytics** ---> My recent focus has been on researching IoT security Analytics, delving into the depths of this critical area and using PowerBi to visualize findings.
- 🌱 **Academic pursuits** ---> My coursework at Norfolk State University has equipped me with a solid foundation in various key areas in Computer Science such as
  - Operating Systems
  - Data Communications
  - Game Design and Development
  - Machine Learning
  - 3D Game Programming
  - Analysis of Algorithms
  - Advanced Computed Architecture
- 🌱Programming Languages
  - C++
  - Python
  - SQL  
- 💞️ **Projects**
  - **Scheduling Algorithm Simulator (C++**) ---> created a simulator for scheduling algorithms (First-Come-First-Served(FCFS), Shortest-Job-Next(SJN) and Round-Robin(RR) to explore their efficiences and behaviors. Analyzed the simulation results using Excel and Power Bi to derive actionable insights.
  - **Game Development with Stencyl** ---> Successfully designed and developed a game that aimed not only to enttertain players but also to educate and reinforce safe driving practices through interactive gameplay.
  - **IoT Security Analytics Research** ---> Conducted research on IoT Security analytics with particular emphasis on how to detect botnet attacks using Deep Autoencoders. Used PowerBi for in-depth visualization of the research results.
